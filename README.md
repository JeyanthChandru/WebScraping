# WebScraping
A Simple Web Scraper using Scrapy with Python

# Dependency Libraries
Numpy, Scrapy, Pandas, Matplotlib
Use pip install for installing the libraries from terminal

# How to run the program
Run the program Scraper.py.

# Is it possible to see the output without running the code?
I have created the program on Jupyter Notebook, which stores the executed version as a checkpoint and displays it. The file Scraper - Jupyter.ipynb is the Notebook file.
